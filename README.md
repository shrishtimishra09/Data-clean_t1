# Medical Dataset Cleaning - Task 1

This project is about cleaning a raw medical dataset using Python and Pandas. The goal is to make the data ready for analysis by fixing issues like missing values, duplicates, and formatting problems.

## What Was Done

- Checked and removed missing values
- Removed duplicate rows
- Cleaned the "Result" column by removing extra spaces and making all text uppercase
- Converted the "age" column to integer type (if present)
- Dropped the "CK-MB" column from the dataset

## Files in This Project

- `task1.py` – Python script used to clean the dataset
- `Medicaldataset.csv.csv` – The original dataset
- `cleaned_medicaldataset.csv` – The cleaned dataset saved after processing
